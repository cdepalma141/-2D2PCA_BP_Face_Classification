# -2D2PCA_BP_Face_Classification
-	Created a neural network for classifying faces of family members using Python with JupyterLab
-	Preprocessed images using (2D)2PCA to reduce 90,000 features to 225 features for training/classification
-	Trained using back-propagation through a Keras neural network
-	Utilized Numpy, Keras, OpenCV, Plotly, and Scikit-Learn
